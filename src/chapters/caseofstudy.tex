In this chapter is explained the case of study inside the D-DUST project, paying attention on the data used in the different period, resolution and target variable. 

\section{Data sets description}
This case of study aims to discover the main factors which affects mostly the target variable chosen. 
Variables selected are the physical and chemical factors that are most associated with the formation of primary and secondary pollutant. \newline
Therefore, the variables are categorized in 4 different labels:
\begin{itemize}
\item Weather: These elements, such as wind speed and direction, precipitation and air temperature, changes in the epochs and can influence air pollution;
\item Pollutant: These variables represent primary and secondary pollutant related to the greenhouse effect;
\item Soil and Vegetation: Since soil and vegetation degradation are global concerns and can influence the air propagation in the environment, data related to local morphology are collected;
\item GIS (time invariant layers): This time-invariant layers are considered to be changeless in the time range considered. Differently from the other types which need a constant monitoring, these variables are update yearly with a lower frequency than the others;
\end{itemize}
Data chosen are open source and regularly available.
In this phase data have been collected (not by me but by other colleagues of D-DUST project at this \underline{ \href{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-5pwMSc1QlFyC8iIaA-l1fWhWtpqVio2/edit\#gid=91313358}{link}}) in grids from different sources and provided in geopackages. 
\subsection{Source types}
In order to better distinguish the data sources characteristics, variables selected are labelled with 4 different types of source:
\begin{itemize}

\item Ground Sensor: Each ground monitoring stations belongs mainly to ARPA (Agenzia Regionale per la Prevenzione dell'Ambiente) and ESA (European Space Agency) provides meteorological and air quality data;
\item Model: data are estimated through a model built using satellite and meteorological and air quality data as input, such as European data provided by CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service);
\item Map layer: this data are time-invariant and are related to Lombardy morphology such as density of roads, population or land use; 
\item Satellite Sensor: They provide data from air quality observation mainly. Satellites provider are Sentinel-5P Tropomi and Terra \& Aqua MODIS;
\end{itemize}

In addition to them, there's also pollutants variables ending with '\_int' (such as 'pm10\_int', 'pm25\_int', 'nh3\_int', etc.). These variables are obtained by interpolating ARPA variables which are not spatially continued. The explanation of how they are interpolated and how I mitigate the problem of having a limited number of observation from ground sensors along the surface is in one of the next \hyperref[subsec:nan]{subsection}.

In order to examine the behavior of each variable in a data set over time, several grid data are collected, each one with different resolution, period and configuration.
\subsection{Spatial resolution}
Vector grids that are used in the D-DUST project are three and they are generated by the spatial resolution of the source provider. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Grids with with Copernicus CAMS resolution (0.1°); resolution with Copernicus CAMS (European);
\item Grids with 0.01° Grid defined with maximum one ARPA station for each cell;
\end{itemize}

Data are scaled and fit in each spatial resolution grid in order to better analyse the final output model by considering each of them. 

\par
\subsection{Period}  
Data collected are dated 2021 because are the most recent and, with respect 2020, the ones not particularly affecting by emission reduction caused by lockdown for COVID-19 pandemic\cite{bontempi2022analysis}. 

In this case of study grid data are chosen by considering the effect of intensive agriculture, with these particular condition:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item In order to have right condition for farming, in the period chosen the terrain shouldn't be frozen (Temperature > 0°C). So I selected data coming from spring, summer and autumn period (discarding winter);
        \item For better highlighting the effect of intense agriculture with the usage of fertilizer and pesticides, which are the main pollution emission factors, weeks with no rains are selected;
\end{itemize}
In this way, several grid data are chosen from 5 different weeks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 24 March - 31 March 2021;
    \item 18 April - 25 April 2021;
    \item 17 July - 24 July 2021;
    \item 3 September - 10 September 2021;
    \item 7 October - 14 October 2021
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Target Variables}
In this study target variables chosen represent the pollution phenomena correlated to agriculture intensive  such as the PM25 and Ammonia emissions. We choose these targets because are the most relevant sources of pollution produced by them.\newline
One of the aim of this step is to detect main pollutant factors which contribute further on the training of PM25 or NH3 emissions.
PM25 and ammonia (NH3) provided by ARPA sensors are the one chosen as target variables('pm25\_st' and 'nh3\_st'). 
ARPA air quality monitoring stations, which, operating 24 h a day 365 days a year, are periodically checked and subject to maintenance, for ensuring the proper functioning and reliability.

\subsection{Mountains}
Another important parameter configuration used is to filter or not the cell covered by mountains or not (climate zone = 1/2/3 of Alpes and Prealpes). In this way the test run can take in consideration or not only urban and land areas, which are more affected by air pollution phenomena.

Firstly data covariates are divided between input (X) and output variable (Y). X represents all of variables collected in the previous part, excepting for the pollutant to be analysed and modelled (such as PM25 or Ammonia) which is assigned to the Y variable.


\section{Data Cleaning of NaN and low-variance values }
\label{subsec:nan}
In my work I consider as target variable PM25 and Ammonia coming from ground sensor measurement.
Air quality monitoring is usually carried out through ground sensors networks, which represents the primary air quality data source by governance. \newline
In the grids processed there's the problem that a given value provided by measurement tools (such as ground and satellite sensor) could be NaN. 
It's feasible since:
\begin{itemize}
\item A sensor could have no measurement for a given time epoch;
\item The set of sensor, because of its limited supply, cannot cover each cell of a grid;
\end{itemize}
In our case variable provided by ARPA and ESA ground sensor (with the label that ends with '\_st' and '\_lcs' respectively) has many NaN cells.
\par
However, no country in the world has yet established a monitoring network with a full satisfying coverage\cite{liu2018improve}. Even in the United States (US), which is characterized by a relatively developed PM2.5 ground monitoring network with 2500 stations has many areas unmonitored\cite{liu2018improve}. \par
In order to mitigate this, I present this solution in sequence, using methods provided by Pandas library:
\begin{itemize}
\item Drop of samples having target variable with NaN value;
\item Drop of columns (values assumed by each covariates) having at least a NaN value;
\end{itemize}
\pagebreak
Due to the fact that it results a data set with a very limited number of sample \cite{zhang2018strategy}, I perform previously a k-nearest neighbour classifier\cite{taunk2019brief} for detecting the buffer of cells closed to the location of the ground stations measurement. For increasing the number of observation provided by the limited ARPA stations in Lombardy a k-nearest neighbors algorithm is applied to adding the buffer of values (with k respectively equal to 10 for 0.1° and 30 for 0.01° resolution).  
Then, these cells are set with values computed using a Radial Basis function interpolation\cite{wright2003radial} which are separately stored in variables with name that ends with '\_int'.\newline
In this way the size of the final sample, as the performance of the feature selection, would increase.
\par
Before the feature selection phase, VarianceThreshold was applied in order to discard variables with variance less than 0.1.

{\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{images/buffer.png}}
 { \caption{Graphical representation of how buffer values interpolated from PM2.5 sensors provided by ARPA are added through k-nearest neighbour.}}
\end{figure}
\section{Feature Selection}
In this phase, I got the list of the most significant variables for each different configuration.
For doing that, after the features are selected for each period, an average of them is performed using again Borda Count algorithm. What is obtained is a general set of variables for each different configuration.
This was computed by averaging the feature selected for each different period with Borda Count another time;
Since I assume 2 different resolution and with the possibility to include or not the mountain zones, I obtained 4 different configurations: (TODO)

In the \ref{fig:test_params} is shown a summary of the parameter of each test execution.
It can be observed that for each parameter there are different configurations: there are 2 resolutions, 2 climate zones parameter and 5 periods. Thus, for each different target variable, have been run 2x2x5 = 20 different tests both for ammonia and fine particulate (40 in total). 
Results from different periods for simplicity are grouped and averaged. In total in this work are attached 8 different results. Each results will be in detail pointed in the final Appendix TODO.

\section{Data Modelling}
After the evaluation of variable selected by each different configuration, models (already explained in the previous chapter) are built and a cross validation for error and accuracy is evaluated. The validation is taken using the test set from test set of the target variable. In addition, a validation with PM25 values assumed by the CAMS models is taken. The validation with CAMS results consists simply in a comparison between the results obtained and the values of the CAMS model.  
\newline
In this way, a comparison between results from these 2 different validations is performed, aiming to detect how much the models perform better in this local scale.\par
